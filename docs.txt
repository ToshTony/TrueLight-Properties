Security Considerations:

Sanitize Inputs: Always sanitize and escape user inputs to avoid SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Use mysqli_real_escape_string() or prepare statements for SQL queries.

Use htmlspecialchars() when displaying user-generated content to prevent XSS.

File Upload Security: If you are allowing file uploads, ensure you check the file type and size to prevent malicious files from being uploaded.



Important Security Note:
When allowing users to upload files, it is important to take extra steps to ensure security:

Validate the file type: Ensure that only image files (e.g., JPG, PNG) are allowed to be uploaded.
Sanitize the file name: Avoid using user input directly in the file name to prevent malicious file names from being executed.
Check file size: Limit the file size to avoid large uploads that could affect server performance.
